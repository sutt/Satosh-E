## Scope

The goal of this project is to create an application that generates images using generative AI models, specifically Dalle2, and leverages the Lightning Network for micro-payments.

### Tracks

- Lightning Network

*Note: We also attempted to implement Sia storage, but facedissues at the API level request.*

## Features

- AI-generated images using Dalle2
- Micro-payments through the Lightning Network

## Getting Started

To set up the Satosh-E project on your local machine, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sutt/Satosh-E.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Satosh-E
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your Lightning Network configuration (follow the [Lightning Network documentation](https://lightning.network) for more information).

5. Run the application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can request AI-generated images and make micro-payments through the Lightning Network.
